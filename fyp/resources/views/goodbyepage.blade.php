                I would like to express my gratitude to all of the volunteers to test and provide feedback to my system prototype, and my friends who are interested to try my system.<br /><br />
                Unfortunately, the final year project has come to an end, which means the system will no longer be supported, updated, or maintained. Starting from 25 September 2021, the whole system will be removed from the web hosting service and all users will not be able to access this website domain.<br /><br />
                Although the project is ended, the journey of the life doesn't. Therefore, I wish all of my fellows can achieve flying colors in their career or their studies.<br /><br />
                
                All the best, thank you, and goodbye.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                Regards,<br />
